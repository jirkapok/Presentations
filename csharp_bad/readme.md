# Bad things in C# since version 7.0

Purpose of this presentation is to balance positive opinions around new things introduced in latest versions of C# (written in 8/2019, e.g. C# 6.0-8.0 versions). I created it becauses only presentations how new features are available, which isn't usually true. Not all features are listed, because not all are bad, and also the listed aren't listed to only be "the dard side", there are always gray colors between white and black. The features have good motivation, why they were introduced, but the bad think is, when they are missused.

> `NOTE`: Read this presentation as alternative opinions only.
